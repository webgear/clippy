This is a simple clipboard manager built using wxPython 2.6. This is meant
to be a very simple tool to help you manage your snippets with ease. Every
copy to the clipboard (while clippy is running) will be copied to a local
sqlite database, so that we can easily add search functionality for clips
and an archive sometimes in the near future.
