This is a simple clipboard manager built using wxPython 2.6 and Python 2.6.
clippy is meant to be a very simple tool to help you manage your snippets with ease.
Clipboard snippets (captured while running clippy, evidently) are saved
into a local sqlite database.
clippy is totally unobtrusive, starting only in a tray icon. If you decide
you need to take action, you can do that with ease, because the program
interface is extremely simple and clean (and we plan on keeping it that
way). 

TODO:
- shorten text that appears in the "Today's snippets" (make this only 30-40
  chars long and find a way to show the full clip somehow)
- automatically refresh the "Today's snippets" when the window is restored
- show last X clips in tray pop-up menu (configurable preferences option)
- "pause recording" mode (pauses the clipboard capturing until re-enabled,
  while keeping clippy open in background) - this will be added to the tray
	  pop-up menu)
- clip search functionality
- clips archive
