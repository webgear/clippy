This is a simple clipboard manager built using wxPython 2.6 and Python 2.6. This is meant
to be a very simple tool to help you manage your snippets with ease.
Clipboard snippets (captured while running clippy, evidently) are saved
into a local sqlite database.

TODO:
- "pause recording" mode (pauses the clipboard capturing until re-enabled,
  while keeping clippy open in background)
- clip search functionality
- clips archive
